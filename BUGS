= ------------------- =

* Since it only updates every minute or so,  bbuptime's accuracy depends on 
  when it was started in relation to the actual uptime. This can make it a 
  few seconds off.  I don't think this matters AT ALL, because when one
  looks at one's uptime, one should only care about days and hours, not
  minutes, and ESPECIALLY not a few seconds.

* The label style for bbuptime is sometimes different from that of other 
  bbtools, sometimes (most of the time actually) it's the same.  I never 
  noticed it before because it doesn't happen with any of the styles I use.  
  After picking through some code, I discovered that because bbdate is old
  as nuts (in comparison to other bbtools anyway), it has severe problems
  with styles using ParentRelative.  To fix this I'd need to update, like,
  EVERYTHING, and I don't feel like doing it now.

* Apparently bbdate had a problem staying on top.  I have no idea if this
  still happens, but if it existed in bbdate it exists in bbuptime also.
