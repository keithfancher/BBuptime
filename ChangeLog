= BBUPTIME CHANGELOG =
= ------------------ =

- Changes for 0.35
  * Fixed more of bbdate's command-line option problems
  * Did a few cleanups in select places (read: places I care about)
  * GCC 3.x compatibility (thanks to Sean "Shaleh" Perry)

- Changes for 0.3
  * Changed around the -help screen (for the better, believe me!)
  * Fixed a couple of bugs remaining from bbdate
  * TOTALLY overhauled the resource system.  Now you've got customized 
    bbuptime resource files, AND now you can create local copies of both the 
    .bb and .nobb files.  Also ditched the now defunct .style file and merged
    with the .bb/.nobb files.
  * Now an excellent application launcher!  You can define up to three 
    separate apps to launch with the left, right, and middle mouse buttons!

- Changes for 0.2
  * Fixed crazy bug when hours == 0

- Changes for 0.1
  * Now it exists
