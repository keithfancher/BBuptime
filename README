NOTE: THIS TOOL IS A MILLION YEARS OLD. DON'T ACTUALLY USE IT. IT LIVES ON
PURELY AS AN HISTORICAN CURIOSITY. /ktf

This is bbuptime, a bbtool that, you guessed it, displays your uptime.  This
was a bbtool I really wanted, so I figured I'd just go write the damn thing.
Seeing your uptime is a good thing, and it's something that is very easily
accomplished for people who use GKrellm and/or WindowMaker dockapps.  I, as an
avid fan of the Blackbox window manager, prefer bbtools.

A somewhat new feature to bbuptime is the ability to launch applications by
clicking on it.  You can set which buttons launch which apps in the config
file.  The reason I decided to do this was that I'm ALWAYS hearing people ask
for a decent app launcher bbtool, something that at the moment doesn't exist.
Now you can pretend you have one.  Cool, ain't it?

Something important to note is that I didn't write this program from scratch.
I took another existing bbtool (bbdate by John Kennis), and modified it to fit
my needs.  The reason I chose bbdate was that it did exactly what I wanted
bbuptime to do, show a simple string inside a bbtool.
